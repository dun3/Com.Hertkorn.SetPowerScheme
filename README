WHAT IS IT
==========

It's a little tool that makes sure that a certain power set is always active while the computer is running. This often is not the case on centrally managed laptops, etc.

HOW TO USE IT
=============

Either set up a task or use the daemon mode to let the program do its work continuously.

HOW TO SET IT UP
================

Either use the config file or use the command-line like this:

Com.Hertkorn.SetPowerScheme.exe <targetPowerSchemeGuid> [--daemon]

WHERE DO I GET THE GUID
=======================

Either use 
c:\Windows\System32\powercfg.exe -list
or copy and paste the guid you get, when running the program without command-line arguments.
